Subject: lockdown: Refer to Debian wiki until manual page exists
Forwarded: not-needed

The lockdown denial log message currently refers to a
"kernel_lockdown.7" manual page, which is supposed to document it.
That manual page hasn't been accepted by the man-pages project and
doesn't even seem to have been submitted yet.  For now, refer to the
Debian wiki.
