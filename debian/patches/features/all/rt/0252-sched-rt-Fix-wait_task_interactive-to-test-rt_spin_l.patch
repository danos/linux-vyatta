Subject: [PATCH 252/397] sched/rt: Fix wait_task_interactive() to test
 rt_spin_lock state
Origin: https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/rt/linux-stable-rt.git/commit?id=dc53f06e32a64381c81c3ce654acf50a0213bd11

The wait_task_interactive() will have a task sleep waiting for another
task to have a certain state. But it ignores the rt_spin_locks state
and can return with an incorrect result if the task it is waiting
for is blocked on a rt_spin_lock() and is waking up.

The rt_spin_locks save the tasks state in the saved_state field
and the wait_task_interactive() must also test that state.
