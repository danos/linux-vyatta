Subject: [PATCH 388/397] x86: Fix an RT MCE crash
Origin: https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/rt/linux-stable-rt.git/commit?id=660ebcb790f475151cf8013d44ea513808f3a321

On some x86 systems an MCE interrupt would come in before the kernel
was ready for it.  Looking at the latest RT code, it has similar
(but not quite the same) code, except it adds a bool that tells if
MCE handling is initialized.  That was required because they had
switched to use swork instead of a kernel thread.  Here, just
checking to see if the thread is NULL is good enough to see if
MCE handling is initialized.
