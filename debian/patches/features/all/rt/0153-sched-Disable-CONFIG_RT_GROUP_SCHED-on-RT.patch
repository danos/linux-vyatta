Subject: [PATCH 153/397] sched: Disable CONFIG_RT_GROUP_SCHED on RT
Origin: https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/rt/linux-stable-rt.git/commit?id=e1cab10cab28562c38f1d26e312ef1ccabdd0086

Carsten reported problems when running:

	taskset 01 chrt -f 1 sleep 1

from within rc.local on a F15 machine. The task stays running and
never gets on the run queue because some of the run queues have
rt_throttled=1 which does not go away. Works nice from a ssh login
shell. Disabling CONFIG_RT_GROUP_SCHED solves that as well.
