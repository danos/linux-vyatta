Subject: ip6_fib: Avoid ABI change in 3.2.95
Forwarded: not-needed

Commit c5cff8561d2d "ipv6: add rcu grace period before freeing
fib6_node" added an rcu_head field to the end of struct fib6_node.
As this structure is always allocated and freed inside of the ipv6
module (or built-in code), we can safely hide it from genksyms.
