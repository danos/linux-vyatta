Subject: crypto: hash: Avoid ABI change in 3.2.102
Forwarded: not-needed

Add back the crypto_ahash::has_setkey field removed by commit
9fa68f620041be04720d0cbfb1bd3ddfc6310b24.  It will only be
uninitialised padding now, but it doesn't appear to have been used by
anything out-of-tree so this should be OK.  Just to make sure of
this, rename it so any remaining users will no longer build.
