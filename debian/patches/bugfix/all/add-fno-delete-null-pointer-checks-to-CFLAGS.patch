    Add '-fno-delete-null-pointer-checks' to gcc CFLAGS
    
    Turning on this flag could prevent the compiler from optimising away
    some "useless" checks for null pointers.  Such bugs can sometimes become
    exploitable at compile time because of the -O2 optimisation.
    
    See http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc-4.1.2/gcc/Optimize-Options.html
    
    An example that clearly shows this 'problem' is commit 6bf67672.
    
     static void __devexit agnx_pci_remove(struct pci_dev *pdev)
     {
         struct ieee80211_hw *dev = pci_get_drvdata(pdev);
    -    struct agnx_priv *priv = dev->priv;
    +    struct agnx_priv *priv;
         AGNX_TRACE;
    
         if (!dev)
             return;
    +    priv = dev->priv;
    
    By reverting this patch, and compile it with and without
    -fno-delete-null-pointer-checks flag, we can see that the check for dev
    is compiled away.
    
        call    printk  #
    -   testq   %r12, %r12  # dev
    -   je  .L94    #,
        movq    %r12, %rdi  # dev,
    
    Clearly the 'fix' is to stop using dev before it is tested, but building
    with -fno-delete-null-pointer-checks flag at least makes it harder to
    abuse.
