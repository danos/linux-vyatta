    vm: fix vm_pgoff wrap in upward expansion
    
    Commit a626ca6a6564 ("vm: fix vm_pgoff wrap in stack expansion") fixed
    the case of an expanding mapping causing vm_pgoff wrapping when you had
    downward stack expansion.  But there was another case where IA64 and
    PA-RISC expand mappings: upward expansion.
    
    This fixes that case too.
