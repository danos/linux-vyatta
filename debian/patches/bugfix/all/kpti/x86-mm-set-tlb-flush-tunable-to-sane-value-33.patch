Subject: x86/mm: Set TLB flush tunable to sane value (33)

commit a5102476a24bce364b74f1110005542a2c964103 upstream.

This has been run through Intel's LKP tests across a wide range
of modern sytems and workloads and it wasn't shown to make a
measurable performance difference positive or negative.

Now that we have some shiny new tracepoints, we can actually
figure out what the heck is going on.

During a kernel compile, 60% of the flush_tlb_mm_range() calls
are for a single page.  It breaks down like this:

We get in to dimishing returns pretty quickly.  On pre-IvyBridge
CPUs, we used to set the limit at 8 pages, and it was set at 128
on IvyBrige.  That 128 number looks pretty silly considering that
less than 0.5% of the flushes are that large.

The previous code tried to size this number based on the size of
the TLB.  Good idea, but it's error-prone, needs maintenance
(which it didn't get up to now), and probably would not matter in
practice much.

Settting it to 33 means that we cover the mallopt
M_TRIM_THRESHOLD, which is the most universally common size to do
flushes.

That's the short version.  Here's the long one for why I chose 33:

1. These numbers have a constant bias in the timestamps from the
   tracing.  Probably counts for a couple hundred cycles in each of
   these tests, but it should be fairly _even_ across all of them.
   The smallest delta between the tracepoints I have ever seen is
   335 cycles.  This is one reason the cycles/page cost goes down in
   general as the flushes get larger.  The true cost is nearer to
   100 cycles.
2. A full flush is more expensive than a single invlpg, but not
   by much (single percentages).
3. A dtlb miss is 17.1ns (~45 cycles) and a itlb miss is 13.0ns
   (~34 cycles).  At those rates, refilling the 512-entry dTLB takes
   22,000 cycles.
4. 22,000 cycles is approximately the equivalent of doing 85
   invlpg operations.  But, the odds are that the TLB can
   actually be filled up faster than that because TLB misses that
   are close in time also tend to leverage the same caches.
6. ~98% of flushes are <=33 pages.  There are a lot of flushes of
   33 pages, probably because libc's M_TRIM_THRESHOLD is set to
   128k (32 pages)
7. I've found no consistent data to support changing the IvyBridge
   vs. SandyBridge tunable by a factor of 16

I used the performance counters on this hardware (IvyBridge i5-3320M)
to figure out the tlb miss costs:

ocperf.py stat -e dtlb_load_misses.walk_duration,dtlb_load_misses.walk_completed,dtlb_store_misses.walk_duration,dtlb_store_misses.walk_completed,itlb_misses.walk_duration,itlb_misses.walk_completed,itlb.itlb_flush

     7,720,030,970      dtlb_load_misses_walk_duration                                    [57.13%]
       169,856,353      dtlb_load_misses_walk_completed                                    [57.15%]
       708,832,859      dtlb_store_misses_walk_duration                                    [57.17%]
        19,346,823      dtlb_store_misses_walk_completed                                    [57.17%]
     2,779,687,402      itlb_misses_walk_duration                                    [57.15%]
        82,241,148      itlb_misses_walk_completed                                    [57.13%]
           770,717      itlb_itlb_flush                                              [57.11%]

Show that a dtlb miss is 17.1ns (~45 cycles) and a itlb miss is 13.0ns
(~34 cycles).  At those rates, refilling the 512-entry dTLB takes
22,000 cycles.  On a SandyBridge system with more cores and larger
caches, those are dtlb=13.4ns and itlb=9.5ns.

cat perf.stat.txt | perl -pe 's/,//g'
	| awk '/itlb_misses_walk_duration/ { icyc+=$1 }
		/itlb_misses_walk_completed/ { imiss+=$1 }
		/dtlb_.*_walk_duration/ { dcyc+=$1 }
		/dtlb_.*.*completed/ { dmiss+=$1 }
		END {print "itlb cyc/miss: ", icyc/imiss, " dtlb cyc/miss: ", dcyc/dmiss, "   -----    ", icyc,imiss, dcyc,dmiss }

On Westmere CPUs, the counters to use are: itlb_flush,itlb_misses.walk_cycles,itlb_misses.any,dtlb_misses.walk_cycles,dtlb_misses.any

The assumptions that this code went in under:
https://lkml.org/lkml/2012/6/12/119 say that a flush and a refill are
about 100ns.  Being generous, that is over by a factor of 6 on the
refill side, although it is fairly close on the cost of an invlpg.
An increase of a single invlpg operation seems to lengthen the flush
range operation by about 200 cycles.  Here is one example of the data
collected for flushing 10 and 11 pages (full data are below):

    10:   0.43%  93.90% avg cycles:  3570 cycles/page:  357 samples: 4714
    11:   0.20%  94.10% avg cycles:  3767 cycles/page:  342 samples: 2145

How to generate this table:

	echo 10000 > /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/buffer_size_kb
	echo x86-tsc > /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/trace_clock
	echo 'reason != 0' > /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/events/tlb/tlb_flush/filter
	echo 1 > /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/events/tlb/tlb_flush/enable

Pipe the trace output in to this script:

	http://sr71.net/~dave/intel/201402-tlb/trace-time-diff-process.pl.txt

Note that these data were gathered with the invlpg threshold set to
150 pages.  Only data points with >=50 of samples were printed:

Here are the tlb counters during a 10-second slice of a kernel compile
for a SandyBridge system.  It's better than IvyBridge, but probably
due to the larger caches since this was one of the 'X' extreme parts.
