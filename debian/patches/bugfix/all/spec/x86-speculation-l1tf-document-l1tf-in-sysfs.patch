Subject: x86/speculation/l1tf: Document l1tf in sysfs

The vulnerabilties/l1tf attribute was added by commit 17dbca119312
"x86/speculation/l1tf: Add sysfs reporting for l1tf", which has
already been backported to 3.16, but only documented in commit
d90a7a0ec83f "x86/bugs, kvm: Introduce boot-time control of L1TF
mitigations", which has not and probbaly won't be.

Add just that line of documentation for now.
