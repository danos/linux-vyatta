Subject: powerpc/64s: Include cpu header
Origin: https://git.kernel.org/linus/42e2acde1237878462b028f5a27d9cc5bea7502c

Current powerpc security.c file is defining functions, as
cpu_show_meltdown(), cpu_show_spectre_v{1,2} and others, that are being
declared at linux/cpu.h header without including the header file that
contains these declarations.

This is being reported by sparse, which thinks that these functions are
static, due to the lack of declaration:

	arch/powerpc/kernel/security.c:105:9: warning: symbol 'cpu_show_meltdown' was not declared. Should it be static?
	arch/powerpc/kernel/security.c:139:9: warning: symbol 'cpu_show_spectre_v1' was not declared. Should it be static?
	arch/powerpc/kernel/security.c:161:9: warning: symbol 'cpu_show_spectre_v2' was not declared. Should it be static?
	arch/powerpc/kernel/security.c:209:6: warning: symbol 'stf_barrier' was not declared. Should it be static?
	arch/powerpc/kernel/security.c:289:9: warning: symbol 'cpu_show_spec_store_bypass' was not declared. Should it be static?

This patch simply includes the proper header (linux/cpu.h) to match
function definition and declaration.
