Subject: Documentation: Move L1TF to separate directory

commit 65fd4cb65b2dad97feb8330b6690445910b56d6a upstream.

Move L!TF to a separate directory so the MDS stuff can be added at the
side. Otherwise the all hardware vulnerabilites have their own top level
entry. Should have done that right away.

 the log message]
