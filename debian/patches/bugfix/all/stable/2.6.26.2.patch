-		ftrace - Function Tracer
-		========================

-Introduction
-------------
-
-Ftrace is an internal tracer designed to help out developers and
-designers of systems to find what is going on inside the kernel.
-It can be used for debugging or analyzing latencies and performance
-issues that take place outside of user-space.
-
-Although ftrace is the function tracer, it also includes an
-infrastructure that allows for other types of tracing. Some of the
-tracers that are currently in ftrace is a tracer to trace
-context switches, the time it takes for a high priority task to
-run after it was woken up, the time interrupts are disabled, and
-more.
-
-
-The File System
----------------
-
-Ftrace uses the debugfs file system to hold the control files as well
-as the files to display output.
-
-To mount the debugfs system:
-
-  # mkdir /debug
-  # mount -t debugfs nodev /debug
-
-
-That's it! (assuming that you have ftrace configured into your kernel)
-
-After mounting the debugfs, you can see a directory called
-"tracing".  This directory contains the control and output files
-of ftrace. Here is a list of some of the key files:
-
-
- Note: all time values are in microseconds.
-
-  current_tracer : This is used to set or display the current tracer
-		that is configured.
-
-  available_tracers : This holds the different types of tracers that
-		has been compiled into the kernel. The tracers
-		listed here can be configured by echoing in their
-		name into current_tracer.
-
-  tracing_enabled : This sets or displays whether the current_tracer
-		is activated and tracing or not. Echo 0 into this
-		file to disable the tracer or 1 (or non-zero) to
-		enable it.
-
-  trace : This file holds the output of the trace in a human readable
-		format.
-
-  latency_trace : This file shows the same trace but the information
-		is organized more to display possible latencies
-		in the system.
-
-  trace_pipe : The output is the same as the "trace" file but this
-		file is meant to be streamed with live tracing.
-		Reads from this file will block until new data
-		is retrieved. Unlike the "trace" and "latency_trace"
-		files, this file is a consumer. This means reading
-		from this file causes sequential reads to display
-		more current data. Once data is read from this
-		file, it is consumed, and will not be read
-		again with a sequential read. The "trace" and
-		"latency_trace" files are static, and if the
-		tracer isn't adding more data, they will display
-		the same information every time they are read.
-
-  iter_ctrl : This file lets the user control the amount of data
-		that is displayed in one of the above output
-		files.
-
-  trace_max_latency : Some of the tracers record the max latency.
-		For example, the time interrupts are disabled.
-		This time is saved in this file. The max trace
-		will also be stored, and displayed by either
-		"trace" or "latency_trace".  A new max trace will
-		only be recorded if the latency is greater than
-		the value in this file. (in microseconds)
-
-  trace_entries : This sets or displays the number of trace
-		entries each CPU buffer can hold. The tracer buffers
-		are the same size for each CPU, so care must be
-		taken when modifying the trace_entries. The number
-		of actually entries will be the number given
-		times the number of possible CPUS. The buffers
-		are saved as individual pages, and the actual entries
-		will always be rounded up to entries per page.
-
-		This can only be updated when the current_tracer
-		is set to "none".
-
-		NOTE: It is planned on changing the allocated buffers
-		      from being the number of possible CPUS to
-		      the number of online CPUS.
-
-  tracing_cpumask : This is a mask that lets the user only trace
-		on specified CPUS. The format is a hex string
-		representing the CPUS.
-
-  set_ftrace_filter : When dynamic ftrace is configured in, the
-		code is dynamically modified to disable calling
-		of the function profiler (mcount). This lets
-		tracing be configured in with practically no overhead
-		in performance.  This also has a side effect of
-		enabling or disabling specific functions to be
-		traced.  Echoing in names of functions into this
-		file will limit the trace to only those files.
-
-  set_ftrace_notrace: This has the opposite effect that
-		set_ftrace_filter has. Any function that is added
-		here will not be traced. If a function exists
-		in both set_ftrace_filter and set_ftrace_notrace
-		the function will _not_ bet traced.
-
-  available_filter_functions : When a function is encountered the first
-		time by the dynamic tracer, it is recorded and
-		later the call is converted into a nop. This file
-		lists the functions that have been recorded
-		by the dynamic tracer and these functions can
-		be used to set the ftrace filter by the above
-		"set_ftrace_filter" file.
-
-
-The Tracers
------------
-
-Here are the list of current tracers that can be configured.
-
-  ftrace - function tracer that uses mcount to trace all functions.
-		It is possible to filter out which functions that are
-		traced when dynamic ftrace is configured in.
-
-  sched_switch - traces the context switches between tasks.
-
-  irqsoff - traces the areas that disable interrupts and saves off
-  		the trace with the longest max latency.
-		See tracing_max_latency.  When a new max is recorded,
-		it replaces the old trace. It is best to view this
-		trace with the latency_trace file.
-
-  preemptoff - Similar to irqsoff but traces and records the time
-		preemption is disabled.
-
-  preemptirqsoff - Similar to irqsoff and preemptoff, but traces and
-		 records the largest time irqs and/or preemption is
-		 disabled.
-
-  wakeup - Traces and records the max latency that it takes for
-		the highest priority task to get scheduled after
-		it has been woken up.
-
-  none - This is not a tracer. To remove all tracers from tracing
-		simply echo "none" into current_tracer.
-
-
-Examples of using the tracer
-----------------------------
-
-Here are typical examples of using the tracers with only controlling
-them with the debugfs interface (without using any user-land utilities).
-
-Output format:
---------------
-
-Here's an example of the output format of the file "trace"
-
-                             --------
-# tracer: ftrace
-#
-#           TASK-PID   CPU#    TIMESTAMP  FUNCTION
-#              | |      |          |         |
-            bash-4251  [01] 10152.583854: path_put <-path_walk
-            bash-4251  [01] 10152.583855: dput <-path_put
-            bash-4251  [01] 10152.583855: _atomic_dec_and_lock <-dput
-                             --------
-
-A header is printed with the trace that is represented. In this case
-the tracer is "ftrace". Then a header showing the format. Task name
-"bash", the task PID "4251", the CPU that it was running on
-"01", the timestamp in <secs>.<usecs> format, the function name that was
-traced "path_put" and the parent function that called this function
-"path_walk".
-
-The sched_switch tracer also includes tracing of task wake ups and
-context switches.
-
-     ksoftirqd/1-7     [01]  1453.070013:      7:115:R   +  2916:115:S
-     ksoftirqd/1-7     [01]  1453.070013:      7:115:R   +    10:115:S
-     ksoftirqd/1-7     [01]  1453.070013:      7:115:R ==>    10:115:R
-        events/1-10    [01]  1453.070013:     10:115:S ==>  2916:115:R
-     kondemand/1-2916  [01]  1453.070013:   2916:115:S ==>     7:115:R
-     ksoftirqd/1-7     [01]  1453.070013:      7:115:S ==>     0:140:R
-
-Wake ups are represented by a "+" and the context switches show
-"==>".  The format is:
-
- Context switches:
-
-       Previous task              Next Task
-
-  <pid>:<prio>:<state>  ==>  <pid>:<prio>:<state>
-
- Wake ups:
-
-       Current task               Task waking up
-
-  <pid>:<prio>:<state>    +  <pid>:<prio>:<state>
-
-The prio is the internal kernel priority, which is inverse to the
-priority that is usually displayed by user-space tools. Zero represents
-the highest priority (99). Prio 100 starts the "nice" priorities with
-100 being equal to nice -20 and 139 being nice 19. The prio "140" is
-reserved for the idle task which is the lowest priority thread (pid 0).
-
-
-Latency trace format
---------------------
-
-For traces that display latency times, the latency_trace file gives
-a bit more information to see why a latency happened. Here's a typical
-trace.
-
-# tracer: irqsoff
-#
-irqsoff latency trace v1.1.5 on 2.6.26-rc8
---------------------------------------------------------------------
- latency: 97 us, #3/3, CPU#0 | (M:preempt VP:0, KP:0, SP:0 HP:0 #P:2)
-    -----------------
-    | task: swapper-0 (uid:0 nice:0 policy:0 rt_prio:0)
-    -----------------
- => started at: apic_timer_interrupt
- => ended at:   do_softirq
-
-#                _------=> CPU#

-
-This shows that the current tracer is "irqsoff" tracing the time
-interrupts are disabled. It gives the trace version and the kernel
-this was executed on (2.6.26-rc8). Then it displays the max latency
-in microsecs (97 us). The number of trace entries displayed
-by the total number recorded (both are three: #3/3). The type of
-preemption that was used (PREEMPT). VP, KP, SP, and HP are always zero
-and reserved for later use. #P is the number of online CPUS (#P:2).
-
-The task is the process that was running when the latency happened.
-(swapper pid: 0).
-
-The start and stop that caused the latencies:
-
-  apic_timer_interrupt is where the interrupts were disabled.
-  do_softirq is where they were enabled again.
-
-The next lines after the header are the trace itself. The header
-explains which is which.
-
-  cmd: The name of the process in the trace.
-
-  pid: The PID of that process.
-
-  CPU#: The CPU that the process was running on.
-
-  irqs-off: 'd' interrupts are disabled. '.' otherwise.
-
-  need-resched: 'N' task need_resched is set, '.' otherwise.
-
-  hardirq/softirq:
-	'H' - hard irq happened inside a softirq.
-	'h' - hard irq is running
-	's' - soft irq is running
-	'.' - normal context.
-
-  preempt-depth: The level of preempt_disabled
-
-The above is mostly meaningful for kernel developers.
-
-  time: This differs from the trace output where as the trace output
-	contained a absolute timestamp. This timestamp is relative
-	to the start of the first entry in the the trace.
-
-  delay: This is just to help catch your eye a bit better. And
-	needs to be fixed to be only relative to the same CPU.
-	The marks is determined by the difference between this
-	current trace and the next trace.
-	 '!' - greater than preempt_mark_thresh (default 100)
-	 '+' - greater than 1 microsecond
-	 ' ' - less than or equal to 1 microsecond.
-
-  The rest is the same as the 'trace' file.
-
-
-iter_ctrl
----------
-
-The iter_ctrl file is used to control what gets printed in the trace
-output. To see what is available, simply cat the file:
-
-  cat /debug/tracing/iter_ctrl
-  print-parent nosym-offset nosym-addr noverbose noraw nohex nobin \
- noblock nostacktrace nosched-tree
-
-To disable one of the options, echo in the option appended with "no".
-
-  echo noprint-parent > /debug/tracing/iter_ctrl
-
-To enable an option, leave off the "no".
-
-  echo sym-offest > /debug/tracing/iter_ctrl
-
-Here are the available options:
-
-  print-parent - On function traces, display the calling function
-		as well as the function being traced.
-
-  print-parent:
-   bash-4000  [01]  1477.606694: simple_strtoul <-strict_strtoul
-
-  noprint-parent:
-   bash-4000  [01]  1477.606694: simple_strtoul
-
-
-  sym-offset - Display not only the function name, but also the offset
-		in the function. For example, instead of seeing just
-		"ktime_get" you will see "ktime_get+0xb/0x20"
-
-  sym-offset:
-   bash-4000  [01]  1477.606694: simple_strtoul+0x6/0xa0
-
-  sym-addr - this will also display the function address as well as
-		the function name.
-
-  sym-addr:
-   bash-4000  [01]  1477.606694: simple_strtoul <c0339346>
-
-  verbose - This deals with the latency_trace file.
-
-    bash  4000 1 0 00000000 00010a95 [58127d26] 1720.415ms \
-    (+0.000ms): simple_strtoul (strict_strtoul)
-
-  raw - This will display raw numbers. This option is best for use with
-	user applications that can translate the raw numbers better than
-	having it done in the kernel.
-
-  hex - similar to raw, but the numbers will be in a hexadecimal format.
-
-  bin - This will print out the formats in raw binary.
-
-  block - TBD (needs update)
-
-  stacktrace - This is one of the options that changes the trace itself.
-		When a trace is recorded, so is the stack of functions.
-		This allows for back traces of trace sites.
-
-  sched-tree - TBD (any users??)
-
-
-sched_switch
-------------
-
-This tracer simply records schedule switches. Here's an example
-on how to implement it.
-
- # echo sched_switch > /debug/tracing/current_tracer
- # echo 1 > /debug/tracing/tracing_enabled
- # sleep 1
- # echo 0 > /debug/tracing/tracing_enabled
- # cat /debug/tracing/trace
-
-# tracer: sched_switch
-#
-#           TASK-PID   CPU#    TIMESTAMP  FUNCTION
-#              | |      |          |         |
-            bash-3997  [01]   240.132281:   3997:120:R   +  4055:120:R
-            bash-3997  [01]   240.132284:   3997:120:R ==>  4055:120:R
-           sleep-4055  [01]   240.132371:   4055:120:S ==>  3997:120:R
-            bash-3997  [01]   240.132454:   3997:120:R   +  4055:120:S
-            bash-3997  [01]   240.132457:   3997:120:R ==>  4055:120:R
-           sleep-4055  [01]   240.132460:   4055:120:D ==>  3997:120:R
-            bash-3997  [01]   240.132463:   3997:120:R   +  4055:120:D
-            bash-3997  [01]   240.132465:   3997:120:R ==>  4055:120:R
-          <idle>-0     [00]   240.132589:      0:140:R   +     4:115:S
-          <idle>-0     [00]   240.132591:      0:140:R ==>     4:115:R
-     ksoftirqd/0-4     [00]   240.132595:      4:115:S ==>     0:140:R
-          <idle>-0     [00]   240.132598:      0:140:R   +     4:115:S
-          <idle>-0     [00]   240.132599:      0:140:R ==>     4:115:R
-     ksoftirqd/0-4     [00]   240.132603:      4:115:S ==>     0:140:R
-           sleep-4055  [01]   240.133058:   4055:120:S ==>  3997:120:R
- [...]
-
-
-As we have discussed previously about this format, the header shows
-the name of the trace and points to the options. The "FUNCTION"
-is a misnomer since here it represents the wake ups and context
-switches.
-
-The sched_switch only lists the wake ups (represented with '+')
-and context switches ('==>') with the previous task or current
-first followed by the next task or task waking up. The format for both
-of these is PID:KERNEL-PRIO:TASK-STATE. Remember that the KERNEL-PRIO
-is the inverse of the actual priority with zero (0) being the highest
-priority and the nice values starting at 100 (nice -20). Below is
-a quick chart to map the kernel priority to user land priorities.
-
-  Kernel priority: 0 to 99    ==> user RT priority 99 to 0
-  Kernel priority: 100 to 139 ==> user nice -20 to 19
-  Kernel priority: 140        ==> idle task priority
-
-The task states are:
-
- R - running : wants to run, may not actually be running
- S - sleep   : process is waiting to be woken up (handles signals)
- D - deep sleep : process must be woken up (ignores signals)
- T - stopped : process suspended
- t - traced  : process is being traced (with something like gdb)
- Z - zombie  : process waiting to be cleaned up
- X - unknown
-
-
-ftrace_enabled
---------------
-
-The following tracers give different output depending on whether
-or not the sysctl ftrace_enabled is set. To set ftrace_enabled,
-one can either use the sysctl function or set it via the proc
-file system interface.
-
-  sysctl kernel.ftrace_enabled=1
-
- or
-
-  echo 1 > /proc/sys/kernel/ftrace_enabled
-
-To disable ftrace_enabled simply replace the '1' with '0' in
-the above commands.
-
-When ftrace_enabled is set the tracers will also record the functions
-that are within the trace. The descriptions of the tracers
-will also show an example with ftrace enabled.
-
-
-irqsoff
--------
-
-When interrupts are disabled, the CPU can not react to any other
-external event (besides NMIs and SMIs). This prevents the timer
-interrupt from triggering or the mouse interrupt from letting the
-kernel know of a new mouse event. The result is a latency with the
-reaction time.
-
-The irqsoff tracer tracks the time interrupts are disabled and when
-they are re-enabled. When a new maximum latency is hit, it saves off
-the trace so that it may be retrieved at a later time. Every time a
-new maximum in reached, the old saved trace is discarded and the new
-trace is saved.
-
-To reset the maximum, echo 0 into tracing_max_latency. Here's an
-example:
-
- # echo irqsoff > /debug/tracing/current_tracer
- # echo 0 > /debug/tracing/tracing_max_latency
- # echo 1 > /debug/tracing/tracing_enabled
- # ls -ltr
- [...]
- # echo 0 > /debug/tracing/tracing_enabled
- # cat /debug/tracing/latency_trace
-# tracer: irqsoff
-#

-    bash-4269  1...2    7us : trace_preempt_on (copy_page_range)
-
-
-vim:ft=help
-
-Here we see that that we had a latency of 6 microsecs (which is
-very good). The spin_lock in copy_page_range disabled interrupts.
-The difference between the 6 and the displayed timestamp 7us is
-because the clock must have incremented between the time of recording
-the max latency and recording the function that had that latency.
-
-Note the above had ftrace_enabled not set. If we set the ftrace_enabled
-we get a much larger output:
-
-# tracer: irqsoff

-Here we traced a 50 microsecond latency. But we also see all the
-functions that were called during that time. Note that enabling
-function tracing we endure an added overhead. This overhead may
-extend the latency times. But never the less, this trace has provided
-some very helpful debugging.

-
-preemptoff
-----------
-
-When preemption is disabled we may be able to receive interrupts but
-the task can not be preempted and a higher priority task must wait
-for preemption to be enabled again before it can preempt a lower
-priority task.
-
-The preemptoff tracer traces the places that disables preemption.
-Like the irqsoff, it records the maximum latency that preemption
-was disabled. The control of preemptoff is much like the irqsoff.

-This has some more changes. Preemption was disabled when an interrupt
-came in (notice the 'h'), and was enabled while doing a softirq.
-(notice the 's'). But we also see that interrupts have been disabled

-
-The above is an example of the preemptoff trace with ftrace_enabled
-set. Here we see that interrupts were disabled the entire time.
-The irq_enter code lets us know that we entered an interrupt 'h'.
-Before that, the functions being traced still show that it is not
-in an interrupt, but we can see by the functions themselves that
-this is not the case.
-
-Notice that the __do_softirq when called doesn't have a preempt_count.
-It may seem that we missed a preempt enabled. What really happened
-is that the preempt count is held on the threads stack and we
-switched to the softirq stack (4K stacks in effect). The code
-does not copy the preempt count, but because interrupts are disabled
-we don't need to worry about it. Having a tracer like this is good
-to let people know what really happens inside the kernel.
-
-
-preemptirqsoff
---------------
-
-Knowing the locations that have interrupts disabled or preemption
-disabled for the longest times is helpful. But sometimes we would
-like to know when either preemption and/or interrupts are disabled.
-
-The following code:
-
-    local_irq_disable();
-    call_function_with_irqs_off();
-    preempt_disable();
-    call_function_with_irqs_and_preemption_off();
-    local_irq_enable();
-    call_function_with_preemption_off();
-    preempt_enable();
-
-The irqsoff tracer will record the total length of
-call_function_with_irqs_off() and
-call_function_with_irqs_and_preemption_off().
-
-The preemptoff tracer will record the total length of
-call_function_with_irqs_and_preemption_off() and
-call_function_with_preemption_off().
-
-But neither will trace the time that interrupts and/or preemption
-is disabled. This total time is the time that we can not schedule.
-To record this time, use the preemptirqsoff tracer.
-
-Again, using this trace is much like the irqsoff and preemptoff tracers.

-This is a very interesting trace. It started with the preemption of
-the ls task. We see that the task had the "need_resched" bit set
-with the 'N' in the trace.  Interrupts are disabled in the spin_lock
-and the trace started. We see that a schedule took place to run
-sshd.  When the interrupts were enabled we took an interrupt.
-On return of the interrupt the softirq ran. We took another interrupt
-while running the softirq as we see with the capital 'H'.
-
-
-wakeup
-------
-
-In Real-Time environment it is very important to know the wakeup
-time it takes for the highest priority task that wakes up to the
-time it executes. This is also known as "schedule latency".
-I stress the point that this is about RT tasks. It is also important
-to know the scheduling latency of non-RT tasks, but the average
-schedule latency is better for non-RT tasks. Tools like
-LatencyTop is more appropriate for such measurements.
-
-Real-Time environments is interested in the worst case latency.
-That is the longest latency it takes for something to happen, and
-not the average. We can have a very fast scheduler that may only
-have a large latency once in a while, but that would not work well
-with Real-Time tasks.  The wakeup tracer was designed to record
-the worst case wakeups of RT tasks. Non-RT tasks are not recorded
-because the tracer only records one worst case and tracing non-RT
-tasks that are unpredictable will overwrite the worst case latency
-of RT tasks.
-
-Since this tracer only deals with RT tasks, we will run this slightly
-different than we did with the previous tracers. Instead of performing
-an 'ls' we will run 'sleep 1' under 'chrt' which changes the
-priority of the task.

-Running this on an idle system we see that it only took 4 microseconds
-to perform the task switch.  Note, since the trace marker in the
-schedule is before the actual "switch" we stop the tracing when
-the recorded task is about to schedule in. This may change if
-we add a new marker at the end of the scheduler.
-
-Notice that the recorded task is 'sleep' with the PID of 4901 and it
-has an rt_prio of 5. This priority is user-space priority and not
-the internal kernel priority. The policy is 1 for SCHED_FIFO and 2
-for SCHED_RR.
-
-Doing the same with chrt -r 5 and ftrace_enabled set.

-The interrupt went off while running ksoftirqd. This task runs at
-SCHED_OTHER. Why didn't we see the 'N' set early? This may be
-a harmless bug with x86_32 and 4K stacks. The need_reched() function
-that tests if we need to reschedule looks on the actual stack.
-Where as the setting of the NEED_RESCHED bit happens on the
-task's stack. But because we are in a hard interrupt, the test
-is with the interrupts stack which has that to be false. We don't
-see the 'N' until we switch back to the task's stack.

-ftrace
-------
-
-ftrace is not only the name of the tracing infrastructure, but it
-is also a name of one of the tracers. The tracer is the function
-tracer. Enabling the function tracer can be done from the
-debug file system. Make sure the ftrace_enabled is set otherwise
-this tracer is a nop.

-
-
-Note: It is sometimes better to enable or disable tracing directly from
-a program, because the buffer may be overflowed by the echo commands
-before you get to the point you want to trace. It is also easier to
-stop the tracing at the point that you hit the part that you are
-interested in. Since the ftrace buffer is a ring buffer with the
-oldest data being overwritten, usually it is sufficient to start the
-tracer with an echo command but have you code stop it. Something
-like the following is usually appropriate for this.
-
-int trace_fd;
-[...]
-int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
-	[...]
-	trace_fd = open("/debug/tracing/tracing_enabled", O_WRONLY);
-	[...]
-	if (condition_hit()) {
-	write(trace_fd, "0", 1);
-	}

-dynamic ftrace
---------------
-
-If CONFIG_DYNAMIC_FTRACE is set, then the system will run with
-virtually no overhead when function tracing is disabled. The way
-this works is the mcount function call (placed at the start of
-every kernel function, produced by the -pg switch in gcc), starts
-of pointing to a simple return.
-
-When dynamic ftrace is initialized, it calls kstop_machine to make it
-act like a uniprocessor so that it can freely modify code without
-worrying about other processors executing that same code.  At
-initialization, the mcount calls are change to call a "record_ip"
-function.  After this, the first time a kernel function is called,
-it has the calling address saved in a hash table.
-
-Later on the ftraced kernel thread is awoken and will again call
-kstop_machine if new functions have been recorded. The ftraced thread
-will change all calls to mcount to "nop".  Just calling mcount
-and having mcount return has shown a 10% overhead. By converting
-it to a nop, there is no recordable overhead to the system.
-
-One special side-effect to the recording of the functions being
-traced, is that we can now selectively choose which functions we
-want to trace and which ones we want the mcount calls to remain as
-nops.
-
-Two files that contain to the enabling and disabling of recorded
-functions are:
-
-  set_ftrace_filter
-
-and
-
-  set_ftrace_notrace
-
-A list of available functions that you can add to this files is listed
-in:
-
-   available_filter_functions
-
- # cat /debug/tracing/available_filter_functions
-put_prev_task_idle
-kmem_cache_create

-  <match>*  - will match functions that begins with <match>
-  *<match>  - will match functions that end with <match>

-We can see that there's no more lock or preempt tracing.
-
-ftraced
--------
-
-As mentioned above, when dynamic ftrace is configured in, a kernel
-thread wakes up once a second and checks to see if there are mcount
-calls that need to be converted into nops. If there is not, then
-it simply goes back to sleep. But if there is, it will call
-kstop_machine to convert the calls to nops.
-
-There may be a case that you do not want this added latency.
-Perhaps you are doing some audio recording and this activity might
-cause skips in the playback. There is an interface to disable
-and enable the ftraced kernel thread.
-
- # echo 0 > /debug/tracing/ftraced_enabled
-
-This will disable the calling of the kstop_machine to update the
-mcount calls to nops. Remember that there's a large overhead
-to calling mcount. Without this kernel thread, that overhead will
-exist.
-
-Any write to the ftraced_enabled file will cause the kstop_machine
-to run if there are recorded calls to mcount. This means that a
-user can manually perform the updates when they want to by simply
-echoing a '0' into the ftraced_enabled file.
-
-The updates are also done at the beginning of enabling a tracer
-that uses ftrace function recording.
-
-
-trace_pipe
-----------
-
-The trace_pipe outputs the same as trace, but the effect on the
-tracing is different. Every read from trace_pipe is consumed.
-This means that subsequent reads will be different. The trace
-is live.

-
-
-Note, reading the trace_pipe will block until more input is added.
-By changing the tracer, trace_pipe will issue an EOF. We needed
-to set the ftrace tracer _before_ cating the trace_pipe file.
-
-
-trace entries
--------------
-
-Having too much or not enough data can be troublesome in diagnosing
-some issue in the kernel. The file trace_entries is used to modify
-the size of the internal trace buffers. The numbers listed
-is the number of entries that can be recorded per CPU. To know
-the full size, multiply the number of possible CPUS with the
-number of entries.
-
- # cat /debug/tracing/trace_entries
-65620
-
-Note, to modify this you must have tracing fulling disabled. To do that,
-echo "none" into the current_tracer.
-
- # echo none > /debug/tracing/current_tracer
- # echo 100000 > /debug/tracing/trace_entries
- # cat /debug/tracing/trace_entries
-100045
-
-
-Notice that we echoed in 100,000 but the size is 100,045. The entries
-are held by individual pages. It allocates the number of pages it takes
-to fulfill the request. If more entries may fit on the last page
-it will add them.
-
- # echo 1 > /debug/tracing/trace_entries
- # cat /debug/tracing/trace_entries
-85
-
-This shows us that 85 entries can fit on a single page.
-
-The number of pages that will be allocated is a percentage of available
-memory. Allocating too much will produces an error.
-
- # echo 1000000000000 > /debug/tracing/trace_entries
--bash: echo: write error: Cannot allocate memory
- # cat /debug/tracing/trace_entries
